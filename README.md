# Turing Machine refactoring using SOLID principles
You have very poorly written Turing Machine code in TuringMachine.java. It works but is hard to maintain and change.

Your task is to apply as much SOLID principles as possible - chop code into pieces to make every class single responsibility: head, rules, tape, etc.

You might use any object-oriented language.


You have *.tmprog.txt or *.tmprog.json files to execute by TM.
Best proof of SOLID would be to demonstrate Turing machine that reads *.tmprog.txt files and then change it to be able to execute *.tmprog.json files.
If you did the design of program correct, these changes should be quite minimal.


Points for the task: (Total  - 10 points)
- Single Responsibility         - 1 point
- Open/Closed                   - 1 point
- Liskov Substitution           - 1 point
- Interface Segregation         - 1 point
- Dependency Inversion          - 1 point
- Application works as expected - 5 points
